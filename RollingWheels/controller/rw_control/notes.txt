ver.34
- added parameter to STOP command
- added ability to init controller by STOP,2 command
- added MOTION_LOCKED state after emergency stop by low echo distance

ver.33
- measure distance in mm and velocity in mm/s

ver.32
- Added KEEP_PARAMETER special value to MOVE command

ver.31:
- Added four ultrasonic sensors support

ver.30:
- Use interrupts to measure ultrasonic echo instead of blocking call pulceIn.
  This decreased maximum blocking waiting time in main loop().

ver.29:
- emergency stop based on echo locator reported range

ver.28:
- Move string table to .h file
- Change power to velocity in MOVE and DELTA commands
- Cleanup here and there

ver.27:
- Queue keeps initial high level commands instead of motor power starting this version.
- Infinite DELTA command execution supported.
- Sanity test command sequence added.
- Test movement initizted by connecting pin10 to ground using 1k resistor during reset.

ver.26:
- last version where queue contains motor parameters.
- then we switched to put initial commands to queue.
- one sound detector supported.
